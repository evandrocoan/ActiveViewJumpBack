# Sublime Active View Jump Back


Creates a wrapper around the Sublime Text jump back and forward commands.

The default Sublime Text `jump_back` and `jump_forward` commands do not work when they are called
from a quick panel as the `Find Panel`. Therefore this package creates a wrapper around these
commands which allow them to be called from anywhere.

The commands are `my_jump_back` and `my_jump_forward` command binded to the keys:

1. ... To do, add the keys here.
1. To do, move the `Tab Context.sublime-menu` and `Context.sublime-menu` into their respective packages.
